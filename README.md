#### Question 7

From the list of IP addresses, check whether all ip addresses are valid.

#### Question 8

Given a list of words followed by two words, the task is to find the minimum distance between the given two words in the list of words. (Example : s = {“the”,”quick”,”brown”,”fox”,”quick”} word1 = “the”, word2 = “fox”, OUTPUT : 1 )

#### Question 9

Write a program that asks the user to enter a username. If the username entered is one of the names in the list then the user is allowed to calculate the factorial of a number. Otherwise, an error message is displayed
